            About Me
          </h2>

          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            I'm an AI Developer and Software Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems.
            My work spans designing scalable backend architecture, building robust software systems, and applying deep learning and LLMs to real-world applications.

          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            
            I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions â€” whether thatâ€™s through building full-stack apps,
            developing generative AI features, or optimizing infrastructure for performance.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me learning the latest in transformer models,
            creating content for my YouTube channel, or working on robotics and consumer-tech side projects that excite me.
